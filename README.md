# Personal-User-Manual-Template

Welcome to my personal user manual. This is a living document but please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss anything here.
    - First, you may want to read The Pitch/Anti-Pitch for Personal User Manuals
    - Search for the Personal User Manual template by clicking on the ... button to the right of 'Create' page above. Note this template is only available in the Hyperdrive space. If you may want to move it back to your own personal space, you may also want to make it private after you do so.


## About Me

I am from Northern Ireland, studied Business Management in the UK and Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning in the US. I work in Identity Infrastructure at Skyscanner in London. Outside of work I am a keen golfer, although I don't get to play much in London. Lately I've been trying, mostly unsuccessfully, to learn how to play the piano. I also mess around with React Native and recently I've been experimenting with with Clojure and [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) in my spare time.
        
> Optional Section: You may want to fill out this as a section to help introduce yourself to new joiners or to people from outside your team. Feel free to keep it light and don't worry about going into much detail about yourself in a professional sense, as that can be covered by later sections. Some suggested points might be where you grew up, what your hobbies are or a fun fact about yourself.

## How to Contact Me

    - I generally prefer slack but if the conversation is wide ranging feel free to start a zoom call or meet in person.
    - I catch up on emails and messages on Sunday evening so if something important comes up feel free to message outside of working hours, I'll make sure to get back to you before Monday morning.

> Essential Section: You might want to think about some caveats here. Perhaps Slack is fine for a quick question but for longer communication you'd prefer to speak in person.

## Preferred Working Style

Typically I prefer quiet work with minimal disruptions. I tend to structure my day to do focused work in the morning and a little after lunch. If you have something to discuss or you want to pair on something I'm always up for that but if it could wait until the afternoon that would be ideal.
    - I'm pretty new to pairing as a working style but I'd like to improve - I'd be particularly interested in expanding my Java and IaC skillset also, so if you spot an opportunity where that could be mutually beneficial please reach out!

> Recommended Section: This section is pretty open to interpretation. You might want to think about practical details like what time of day you focus best, or whether you have external commitments at specific times. Equally you can include more abstract details like whether you find certain kinds of collaboration helpful to get your work done (pairing or shadowing work for example).

## What Motivates Me

    - I am equally interested in the the low level implementation details as well as the high level product and business motivation for the work. I enjoy a technical challenge and even more so if there are tangible outcomes which benefit our consumers.
    - I am passionate about learning so when the opportunity arises to try a new technology or approach that is always motivating.
    - I enjoy the process of gathering data, learning and iterating. In many ways I find that more fulfilling than getting it right first time.
    
> Recommended Section: Think about what gives you energy in work. What, about the work that you do, motivates you to push yourself? This doesn't need to be inspirational, it can be as simple as you enjoying seeing the results. The purpose of this section is to help your line manager and squad members to gain a picture of the work each person finds meaningful and interesting.

## What Demotivates Me

    - I don't particularly enjoy writing documentation for existing services. Although I do enjoy writing design documents and documenting services as they are being built, so I think it's the piecing together of stale information that I find a little frustrating.
    - I enjoy debating the merits of different approaches, I feel I learn a lot from others through that process. However when discussions become a battle of opinions over data, where data is available, I find that can be demotivating.

> Recommended Section: The flip side of the above. Everyone has parts of their work they find less interesting, and they won't be the same for everyone. You never know, a task you find impossibly tedious might be something someone else really enjoys - if so, you've discovered a win-win!

## My Values (and what I value in others)

    - Dedication with empathy. I admire people who are driven and who value the truth but hold other’s feelings in equally high regard.
    - Integrity. I believe that that technology is a positive force of good but that we must decide to act with integrity on behalf of our users.
    - Commitment. I value ideas backed up with action.

> Recommended Section: Accepting that we all treat each other with empathy, care and respect as a baseline. What values do you hold in the highest regard? What traits make you admire a person?

## My Blind Spots

    - I'm always open to directed constructive feedback, feel free to drop me a message with anything you think might be helpful. I do need to remember to send feedback requests but if I don't and you'd prefer your feedback was anonymous don't hesitate to leave it in Impraise. Some areas I'm working on:
        - Understanding cloud infrastructure and IaC
        - Improving my knowledge of Java
        - Understanding testing best practices
    - I really enjoy learning from the experience of others. It's also a huge bonus if you have book or talk recommendations.

> Recommended Section: Everyone needs help sometimes. This is a good section to list the things you know you need help with or actively want feedback on. One caveat is that listing something here doesn't automatically excuse it! If you know you need to work on a particular area then please make sure you are doing so, soliciting feedback to measure your progress.

## My Pet Peeves
    - Debating with opinions when data is available
    - People who interrupt others. Sometimes it's hard to get the timings right over zoom, but if I ever do this to you please call me out!
    - When people view work (or life) as a zero sum game.
> Optional Section: It might be tempting to use this section to vent, that's absolutely fine but the more constructive the better. If there are simple things people can reasonably avoid doing, then list them here. Bear in mind that you will also need to also read your squad members' pet peeves section, it's a 2 way street.

## Other
    - Please feel free to send me feedback requests - I'm always happy to complete them.

> Optional Section: There are some sections that are deliberately omitted from this template, but which arguably should be here - depending on your role, how comfortable you are sharing with your team etc. You may want to include these or use them as inspiration for your own.

            - "How I like my 1:1s" - This might be more relevant for managers to set expectations of their direct reports. Although direct reports certainly should have a say in how their 1:1s are structured
            - "Quirks" - While this is a fun one, there is a temptation to hide behaviour here that probably should be worked on instead. Additionally, behaviour is complex, situation dependent and evolving. Stating you have a particular quirk makes it immutable and sets the expectation that you will always act like this. That said please feel free to include a section like this as it's a good icebreaker, and adds a personal touch. Just be aware that you might be unaware of some of your own "quirky" behaviour.
            - "How to interpret my calendar" - If you're someone with wall to wall meetings every day it might be difficult for colleagues to find a good time to speak with you. If this is the case, then this section might be helpful to outline when you typically could make time for them.
            - "What you can expect from me" - Another one that might be useful for line managers, career coaches and mentors more than ICs. You may want to use this to set expectations around how often you'll be scheduling catchups, how you share feedback and what sort of support you can offer.
